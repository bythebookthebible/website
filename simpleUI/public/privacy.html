    <h2>3. Disclosure</h2>

      encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is

    <h2>6. Third Party Services</h2>
    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the
      extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
    <p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
      processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for
      your purchase-related transactions.</p>
    <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which
      your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
    <p>Certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either
      you or us. If you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service
      provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service
      provider or its facilities are located.</p>
    <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the
      United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure
      under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
    <p>Once you leave our course website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer
      governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>
    <p>Links - When you click on links on our course site, they may direct you away from our site. We are not
      responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>
    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make
      sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
    <p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer
      technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or
      electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted
      industry standards.</p>
