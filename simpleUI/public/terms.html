    <h2>12. ARBITRATION</h2>
    <p>Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. ByTheBookTheBible and you (such references include our
      respective subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns) agree to arbitrate all
      disputes and claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement between ByTheBookTheBible and you.</p>
    <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send written notice to ByTheBookTheBible of its intent to
      arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to ByTheBookTheBible should be sent by any of the following means: electronic
      message by sending an email to <a href='mailto:support@bythebookthebible.com'>support@bythebookthebible.com</a>.
      The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and (b) set forth the specific relief
      sought. If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or
      ByTheBookTheBible may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
    <p>The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary
      Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association
      (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and shall be administered by the AAA. All issues are for the arbitrator to
      decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this
      Agreement.</p>
    <p>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and ByTheBookTheBible are waiving the right to a trial by
      jury.</p>
    <p>The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the
      extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. You and ByTheBookTheBible agree
      that YOU AND ByTheBookTheBible MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not
      as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, you agree that the
      arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over
      any form of a representative or class proceeding and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable,
      then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.</p>
    <h2>13. MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS OF USE.</h2>
    <p>ByTheBookTheBible may change, modify, update, add or remove portions of these Terms of Use at any time. Please
      review these Terms of Use periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Company’s Service following the
      posting of any changes will signify your acceptance of those changes.</p>
    <h2>14. MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and ByTheBookTheBible regarding this subject
      matter and govern your use of the Site. By accessing the Site, you agree that the statutes and laws of the United
      States and the State of Washington, without regard to any principles of conflicts of law, will apply to all
      matters relating to the use of this Site and use of ByTheBookTheBible.</p>
    <p>The failure of ByTheBookTheBible to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use does not
      constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these
      Terms of Use to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
      parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full
      force and effect. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or
      related to use of the Site or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of
      action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no
      legal or contractual effect.</p>
