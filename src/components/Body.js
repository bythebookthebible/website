						<h1>Why Memorize?</h1>
						<em>Raising Godly kids is the most influential, world changing job</em> on the planet, yet in this culture, it’s certainly not easy to raise Godly children with a sound unshakable faith. Our hope is that By the Book the Bible can be an effective tool to help you along the way to raising warriors for Christ!
						<p>
							I believe memorizing Scripture in context is powerful in training up warriors for Christ. Here’s why: 
						</p>
						<p>
							1) <em>God speaks through his word.</em> Most conversions, life changing moments, and growth begin and end with the Bible. As valuable as sermons and speeches are, what really changes lives is encountering God through His word. Memorizing the Bible is a great way to surround kids with this living word. “meditate on them - bind on your heart always; tie them around your neck. When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.”
						</p>
						<p>
							2) <em>Thoughts determine conversations and actions.</em> It is known that whatever people think about the most, they talk about the most, the Bible says, “Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.” What better way to do this than to constantly have the Bible stuck in your child’s head? If our kids are constantly thinking about the Bible through memory, it will begin to influence their conversations and actions. “How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word.” 
						</p>
						<p>
							3) <em>Verses in context prepare us for Battle.</em> Ephesians tells us that the Sword of The Spirit is the Word of God. Beyond simply memorizing individual verses, memorizing by the book or chapter ensures that verses are taken in their intended context. This helps creates a solid faith foundation, so kids can stand strong against this confused pluralistic culture. God will bring these verses to their mind at the most random moments and often it’s just the tool needed to fight off temptation.
						</p>

						<h1>How is it possible?</h1>
						<p>
							<em>I believe your kids are smarter than they look</em> and are capable of memorizing huge portions of scripture.  Five-year-olds in Jesus’s day memorized the book of Leviticus, modern Muslim children often memorize the whole Quran, and the average American has hundreds of song lyrics memorized. This shows us it’s possible for little people to memorize big things, so if we believe the Bible is the living, inspired Word of God Almighty, let’s memorize it!  How? We have found the most effective method to be music. (I mean seriously, did you have to hit your head against a book trying to memorize the lyrics to Jingle Bells...no!) And Bible memory can be just as easy if we put it to a song! 
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>I believe we can make memorizing the Bible fun and entertaining</em> without compromising the message. If something is fun, kids will want to do it for as long as they can. Many kids spend hours watching Disney or kids-shows that accidentally imprint bad morals on them: ‘parents are the bad guys’ ‘you can lie if it’s to help a friend’... etc. Kids aren’t particularly attracted to the bad morals themselves, but to the glitter, vibrant colors, and entertaining characters. But since God is the one who created sparkles, colors and characters, there’s no reason God can’t be on the fun list! In this curriculum we aim to use God’s invincible force of fun to our advantage!

						<h1>Our Strategy:</h1>				
						<Slogans />

						I believe there are three essential aspects that need to be fulfilled to have a successful Bible memory program. Colossians encapsulates them all very well when it says, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms , hymns and spiritual songs.” First of all, it is very important that the kids effectively can actually recall and retain huge portions of scripture in long-term memory. This is the first pillar of our program, <em>“We memorize by the Book.”</em> However, rote memory is completely useless unless they know what the verses mean and how to apply it to their lives. This is our second pillar, <em>“We live our lives by the Book.”</em> Thirdly, if kids don’t have a positive internal motivation to memorize, the process will be ineffective and boring. This is our third pillar, <em>“We’re energized by the Book”</em> In light of our three essential pillars, we provide different services to conquer each of those areas. 

						<h2>Memorize by the Book: “I know it!”</h2>
						<h3>Dance Videos:</h3>
						There are tons of little kids that can recite the lyrics to “Let it Go” or “Three Little Monkeys,” so similarly, we use tunes as the main source of memory. Every 3-10 verses we provide a video that shows a dance (for visual and kinesthetic learners) and a song (for auditory learners). When kids watch, sing, dance, and listen to this video throughout the week, it gets stuck in their head and they accidentally memorize it! 

						<h3>Coloring Pages:</h3>
						To learn the material even more, we have coloring pages so the kids can illustrate each verse we memorize. These will be combined into one binder.

						<h2>Live our lives by the book: “I understand it!”</h2>
						<h3>Lesson Videos:</h3>
						There will be short videos that explain one aspect of the verse in more depth and shows (using a story) how to apply it to the kid’s own lives. 

						<h3>Discussion Questions:</h3>
						The most effective way that kids can learn what a verse means is one-on- one conversation. Discussion questions encourage conversations between parents and kids – encouraging them to think critically and ask questions. 

						<h2>Energized by the Book: “It’s fun!”</h2>
						<h3>Crafts:</h3>
						Often times a coloring page will become part of a craft. we have topical crafts combined into the coloring page book.

						<h3>Games:</h3>
						Our curriculum provides memory review games as well as games that help illustrate a point.

						<h3>Memory Jewels:</h3>
						Kids love external motivations, so we provide external motivation in the form of memory jewels. Every time your child Memorizes a video, he/she will earn a jewel with the verse reference on it. They will collect these jewels in a special box that will eventually be full of treasure, symbolizing the eternal treasure hidden in their hearts! “There is gold and abundance of costly stones, but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.”

						<Slogans />

						<em>Five-year-olds</em> in Jesus’ day <em>memorized</em> Leviticus; <b>Americans memorize</b> hundreds of song lyrics; many <y>Muslims memorize</y> the whole Quran; so if we believe in the inspiration of scripture, Let’s memorize it! 

						You never had to hit your head against a book trying to memorize the lyrics to Jingle bells because it was catchy - so why not do the same with the Bible? Hey, God invented fun! So that’s what I did - I’m a kid-loving, ballerina, harpist, artist who has started putting the Bible to catchy tunes in order to ground the next generation in a Biblical worldview. I am excited to see how the Holy Spirit will use these words of God as a sword to fight for the hearts and minds of children. My goal is to help plant God’s eternal treasure of His word through memory. Hope you enjoy!
